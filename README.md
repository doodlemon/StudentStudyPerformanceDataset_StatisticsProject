**Student Study Performance Analysis**
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/impapan/student-performance-data-set

This project explores the factors affecting student performance based on the Student Study Performance Dataset. The analysis aims to investigate the following questions:

**Who performs better: Males or Females?**

What other factors (e.g., ethnicity, lunch type) influence student marks?

The project involves data cleaning, data visualization, and statistical hypothesis testing (Z-test and Q-test) to draw insights from the dataset.

**Project Overview**

The dataset contains information about students' demographic attributes, study time, and their performance on various assessments. By analyzing this data, we attempt to uncover patterns and answer questions about how various factors like gender, ethnicity, and lunch type impact students' academic performance.

**Key Steps in the Analysis**
Data Cleaning

Handling missing values

Correcting any inconsistencies in the dataset

Formatting columns for analysis

Data Exploration

**Descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation)**

**Visualizations (histograms, bar charts, scatter plots)**

**Statistical Testing**

**Z-Test**: Comparing the means of two groups (e.g., male vs. female students) to see if there's a significant difference in performance.

**Q-Test**: Identifying any outliers in the dataset that could skew results.

**Hypothesis Testing**

Testing the impact of factors like ethnicity and lunch type on student performance.
Results and Insights

Conclusions on gender differences in performance

Insights into how other factors like ethnicity and lunch type influence student marks

**Technologies Used**
Python

Pandas for data manipulation

Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

Scipy for statistical testing

Jupyter Notebook for documentation and analysis

Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is the Student Study Performance Dataset. It contains the following features:

Gender: Male or Female

Ethnicity: Ethnic background of the student

Lunch: Type of lunch (e.g., standard or free/reduced)

Study time: Amount of study time per week

Marks: Final grades of the student
